            <pre>
                Zinda, hain toh, pyala, poora bhar le Kancha, phoote, choora,
                Zindagi ka ye ghada le
                Ek saans mein chadha le
                Hichkiyon mein kya hai marna!
                Poora mar le...
                Koyla kaala hai
                Chattanon ne paala
                Andar kaala, baahar kaala
                Par saccha hai saala
            </pre>
